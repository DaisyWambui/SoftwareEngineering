Software Engineering Day1 Assignment


#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing,building,testing, and maintaining software.
Software engineering supports software maintainability and scalability.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured programming was introduced in the 1970s, which led to better code organisation and maintenance.
Agile methodologies in the 1990s and are still present.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: It involves defining the software's purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route. 
Requirement analysis: seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users.
Design:  Design phase is all about building the framework
Implementation: when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.
Testing: Quality inspections.
Deployment: Releasing software for use.
Maintaining: Updating and fixing issues after release.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model follows a sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It is rigid and linear, making it less adaptable to changes. Feedback is typically received at a late stage, which can result in costly revisions. It is best suited for large-scale government projects where requirements are well-defined from the start. On the other hand, the Agile model is iterative and incremental, allowing for continuous development and improvements. It is highly adaptable to changes, with continuous feedback throughout the process. Agile is most suitable for startups and software products that require frequent updates and evolving requirements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: Designs,builds, and tests software applications.
Quality assurance engineer: Responsible for ensuring that products and services meet quality standards.
Project manager: Oversees project scope, timeline, and resources.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide an environment to write codes, debug and test codes efficiently. An example is Visual Studio Code.
Version Control Systems help in collaboration and change tracking in codes. An example is Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Meeting deadlines: This can be solved by using agile methodologies and project management tools like jira.
Debugging and fixing issues in code: Implement automated testing and code reviews.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
Integration testing: verifies that different modules or services used by your application work well together.  
System testing: Assesses overall system behavior.
Acceptance testing: Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective questions or statements to interact optimally with AI models. It enhances AI responses by making queries specific and structured.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about data engineering."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the key responsibilities of a data engineer, including data pipeline development, ETL processes, and tools like Apache Spark and Airflow."
Why the Improved Prompt is Better:
It specifies the focus on responsibilities rather than a broad topic.
It highlights key concepts like data pipelines and ETL processes.
It ensures a more detailed and relevant response.
